Let's HELP YOU with a VIP way to  REPLAY the Witcher 3 for the Ciri Story AND DLCS


WITHOUT THE ACTUAL  GRIND and with all the HIDDEN LOOT possible. 


My Savefiles contains all of the
COMPATIBLE !
NO conflicts !
4.04 NEXT GEN  mods from Nexus .com !


WORK a full DAY, with my tutorial, to access my SAVEFILE and save up ~300 hours of GRINDING, hidden unmarked treasures, hidden quests, locations  etc.


First. Do your windows update if you have one !
UPDATE  all of your  DRIVERS to latest like  graphics card, sound , Bluetooth, system apps from Microsoft store etc.


After restart pc, download the latest net framework and redistributables from Microsoft

Fresh install Steam , then Witcher 3 on THE SECOND Storage aka  D PARTITION !

Mods on the C drive with Windows System causes ERRORS with modding games(cuz security stuff) that's why AVOID this.


Follow the folders I created

1, 2, 3, 4 is the order to follow.

( see PICTURES and READ Text files )


IF any of this doesn't work for you, game stutter or you lose FPS from mods, errors etc, then BUY the quantum NASA PC  because Witcher 4 is also coming and it will be more advanced than this 10 yr old lovely game.
